### 🔥 What is vps-deployster?

`vps-deployster` is a lightweight command-line tool that securely connects to a self-hosted webhook server and deploys code on your VPS with real-time feedback. It’s perfect for developers who want the power of continuous deployment without the overhead of full CI/CD pipelines or platform lock-in.

It uses:

- GitHub Actions or manual triggers to start deployment

- Redis to store logs and status

- A Node.js server (your own backend) to execute deployment commands

- Streaming or polling to monitor logs live
